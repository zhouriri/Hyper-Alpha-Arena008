---

## Required Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{output_format}` | **MUST INCLUDE** - JSON output schema and format requirements. Ensures AI returns valid, parseable JSON. |
| `{trigger_context}` | **RECOMMENDED** - Trigger context information. Tells AI what triggered this decision (signal or scheduled) and provides signal details when triggered by signal pool. |

### Trigger Context Format

When triggered by **signal pool**:
```
=== TRIGGER CONTEXT ===
trigger_type: signal
signal_pool_name: OI Surge Monitor
pool_logic: OR
trigger_symbol: BTC
triggered_signals:
  - name: OI Delta Signal
    metric: oi_delta_percent
    condition: > 2.0
    current_value: 3.5
```

When triggered by **wallet signal** (Hyper Insight wallet tracking):
```
=== TRIGGER CONTEXT ===
trigger_type: wallet_signal
signal_pool_name: BTC Whale Tracker
trigger_symbol: ETH
address: 0x84d5c9e6a6944356a01ffc9728610227bd1a670e
event_type: position_change
event_level: significant
summary: Real-time: opened ETH $50,000
action: open
direction: long
notional_value: 50000.0
start_position: 0.0
end_position: 20.0
entry_price: 2500.5
leverage: 10
unrealized_pnl: 420.0
liquidation_price: 2100.0
average_price: 2500.5
closed_pnl: 0.0
fills_count: 5
```

Wallet signal fields:
- `event_type`: position_change, equity_change, funding, transfer, liquidation
- `event_level`: normal, significant, critical
- `tier` (in summary prefix): "Real-time" (paid WS fills) or "Polling" (snapshot diff)
- `action`: open, close, add, reduce, flip, update (position_change only)
- `direction`: long, short, flat (position_change only)
- Shared position fields: `start_position`, `end_position`, `old_value`, `new_value`, `notional_value`
- Position context when available: `entry_price`, `leverage`, `unrealized_pnl`, `liquidation_price`
- Realtime-only fields: `average_price`, `closed_pnl`, `fills_count`, `fills`

When triggered by **scheduled interval**:
```
=== TRIGGER CONTEXT ===
trigger_type: scheduled
trigger_interval: 150 seconds
```

**Why include this?** The AI can make more informed decisions when it knows:
- What triggered the analysis (signal vs scheduled check)
- Which specific signals fired and their values
- The market conditions that caused the trigger

## Order Execution Variables (Advanced)

These variables control how orders are executed on Hyperliquid.

| Variable | Description | Values | Default |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| `time_in_force` | Order time-in-force mode | "Ioc", "Gtc", "Alo" | "Ioc" |
| `tp_execution` | Take profit execution mode | "market", "limit" | "limit" |
| `sl_execution` | Stop loss execution mode | "market", "limit" | "limit" |

### Time-in-Force Options

| Value | Description | Fee Impact |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `Ioc` | Immediate or Cancel - fills immediately or cancels unfilled portion | Always taker fee (0.0432%) |
| `Gtc` | Good Til Canceled - remains on order book until filled or canceled | May become maker (0.0144%) if not immediately filled |
| `Alo` | Add Liquidity Only (Post-Only) - only adds to order book, never takes | Always maker fee (0.0144%), but may not fill in fast markets |

### TP/SL Execution Modes

| Value | Description | Fee Impact | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------------|------|
| `market` | Executes immediately at market price when triggered | Taker fee (0.0432%) | Guaranteed fill |
| `limit` | Places limit order with 0.05% offset to attempt maker status | May get maker fee (0.0144%) | May not fill in fast markets |

**Note**: For TP limit mode, the system adds a 0.05% price offset:
- Long position TP (sell): `limit_price = trigger_price * 1.0005`
- Short position TP (buy): `limit_price = trigger_price * 0.9995`

This offset increases the chance of becoming a maker order while still ensuring reasonable fill probability.

---

## Symbol Selection Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{selected_symbols_csv}` | Comma-separated symbol list | "BTC, ETH, SOL" |
| `{selected_symbols_detail}` | Detailed symbol information | "BTC: Bitcoin\nETH: Ethereum" |
| `{selected_symbols_count}` | Number of selected symbols | "6" |

---

## K-line and Technical Indicator Variables (Advanced)

These variables are dynamically generated based on your template. Add them to get technical analysis data.

### Syntax

**IMPORTANT**: `SYMBOL` is a placeholder - you must replace it with actual symbol names (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.). The system will NOT auto-replace `SYMBOL` for you.

| Pattern | You Must Write | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| `SYMBOL_klines_PERIOD` | Replace SYMBOL with actual symbol | `{BTC_klines_15m}`, `{ETH_klines_1h}` |
| `SYMBOL_market_data` | Replace SYMBOL with actual symbol | `{BTC_market_data}`, `{SOL_market_data}` |
| `SYMBOL_INDICATOR_PERIOD` | Replace SYMBOL with actual symbol | `{BTC_RSI14_15m}`, `{ETH_MACD_1h}` |

**Wrong** (will show nothing):
```
{SYMBOL_market_data}
{SYMBOL_RSI14_15m}
```

**Correct** (will show actual data):
```
{BTC_market_data}
{BTC_RSI14_15m}
```

### Supported Periods

`1m`, `3m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h`, `12h`, `1d`, `3d`, `1w`, `1M`

### Supported Indicators

| Indicator | Variable Example | Description |

| RSI (14) | `{BTC_RSI14_15m}` | Relative Strength Index (14-period) |
| RSI (7) | `{BTC_RSI7_15m}` | Relative Strength Index (7-period, faster) |
| MACD | `{BTC_MACD_15m}` | MACD line, signal line, histogram |
| Stochastic | `{BTC_STOCH_15m}` | Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D) |
| MA | `{BTC_MA_15m}` | Moving Averages (MA5, MA10, MA20) |
| EMA | `{BTC_EMA_15m}` | Exponential MAs (EMA20, EMA50, EMA100) |
| Bollinger | `{BTC_BOLL_15m}` | Bollinger Bands (upper, middle, lower) |
| ATR | `{BTC_ATR14_15m}` | Average True Range (volatility) |
| VWAP | `{BTC_VWAP_15m}` | Volume Weighted Average Price |
| OBV | `{BTC_OBV_15m}` | On-Balance Volume |

### Example Usage

To add BTC technical analysis to your prompt:

```
=== TECHNICAL ANALYSIS ===
{BTC_market_data}
{BTC_klines_15m}
{BTC_RSI14_15m}
{BTC_MACD_15m}
```

## Market Regime Classification Variables (Advanced)

Market Regime variables provide AI-ready classification of current market conditions, combining multiple flow indicators into actionable regime types.

### Available Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{market_regime_description}` | Indicator calculation methodology and regime type definitions (include once for AI context) |
| `{market_regime}` | All symbols summary (default 5m timeframe) |
| `{market_regime_1m}` | All symbols summary (1-minute timeframe) |
| `{market_regime_5m}` | All symbols summary (5-minute timeframe) |
| `{market_regime_15m}` | All symbols summary (15-minute timeframe) |
| `{market_regime_1h}` | All symbols summary (1-hour timeframe) |
| `{BTC_market_regime}` | BTC regime only (default 5m) |
| `{BTC_market_regime_1m}` | BTC regime (1-minute) |
| `{BTC_market_regime_5m}` | BTC regime (5-minute) |
| `{BTC_market_regime_15m}` | BTC regime (15-minute) |
| `{BTC_market_regime_1h}` | BTC regime (1-hour) |
| `{trigger_market_regime}` | **Trigger Snapshot**: The market regime captured at signal trigger time. Only available for signal triggers (N/A for scheduled triggers). Use this to ensure AI sees the same regime that caused the trigger, not the current real-time regime. |

Similar patterns available for ETH, SOL, and other supported symbols.

**Important**: `{trigger_market_regime}` differs from real-time regime variables:
- Real-time variables (`{BTC_market_regime_5m}`, etc.) are calculated at prompt generation time
- `{trigger_market_regime}` is the regime snapshot from when the signal pool triggered
- Use `{trigger_market_regime}` when you want AI decisions to be based on the exact market conditions that triggered the signal

### Regime Types

| Regime | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `breakout` | Strong directional move with volume confirmation |
| `absorption` | Large orders absorbed without price impact (potential reversal) |
| `stop_hunt` | Wick beyond range then reversal (liquidity grab) |
| `exhaustion` | Extreme RSI with diverging CVD (trend weakening) |
| `trap` | Price breaks level but CVD/OI diverge (false breakout) |
| `continuation` | Trend continuation with aligned indicators |
| `noise` | No clear pattern, low conviction |

### Output Format

```
[BTC/5m] stop_hunt (bullish) conf=0.44 | cvd_ratio=0.286, oi_delta=0.01%, taker=1.80, rsi=50.7
```

- `[SYMBOL/TIMEFRAME]` - Symbol and timeframe context
- `regime (direction)` - Classified regime type and direction (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- `conf=X.XX` - Confidence score (0-1)
- Indicator values: cvd_ratio, oi_delta, taker ratio, RSI

### Indicator Definitions

- **cvd_ratio**: CVD / (Taker Buy + Taker Sell). Positive = net buying pressure
- **oi_delta**: Open Interest change percentage over the period
- **taker**: Taker Buy/Sell ratio. >1 = aggressive buying, <1 = aggressive selling
- **rsi**: RSI(14) momentum indicator. >70 overbought, <30 oversold

### Example Usage

```
=== MARKET REGIME ANALYSIS ===
{market_regime_description}

Current Market Regimes:
{market_regime_5m}

Hourly Context:
{BTC_market_regime_1h}
{ETH_market_regime_1h}
```

## Legacy Variables (Backward Compatibility)

| Variable | Description | Recommended Alternative |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| `{account_state}` | Raw account state text | Use `{available_cash}` + `{total_account_value}` |
| `{prices_json}` | Prices in JSON format | Use `{market_prices}` |
| `{portfolio_json}` | Portfolio in JSON format | Use `{holdings_detail}` |
| `{session_context}` | Legacy session info | Use `{runtime_minutes}` + `{current_time_utc}` |

---

## Factor Variables (Advanced)

Factor variables inject real-time factor values and effectiveness metrics into your prompt.

### Format

`{SYMBOL_factor_PERIOD_NAME}` — e.g., `{BTC_factor_1h_RSI21}`, `{ETH_factor_5m_MOM10}`

Legacy syntax `{SYMBOL_factor_NAME}` still works and defaults to `5m`, but new templates should always specify the period explicitly.

### Output Content

Each variable resolves to a text block with factor metadata, period, real-time value, and effectiveness:

```
name=RSI21(id=5) | period=1h | expr=RSI(close, 21) | desc=RSI with 21-period lookback | value=0.0234 | IC=0.0512 | ICIR=1.35 | WinRate=52.0% | Persistent
```

- **name(id)**: Factor name and database ID
- **period**: K-line period used to compute the factor value
- **expr**: Factor expression formula
- **desc**: Human-readable description
- **value**: Real-time factor value computed from the latest 500 K-lines of the specified period
- **IC**: Information Coefficient (predictive power, daily average)
- **ICIR**: IC Information Ratio (IC stability, higher = more reliable)
- **WinRate**: Percentage of days factor correctly predicted direction
- **Decay**: `Persistent` (IC strengthens over time) or `Decay=Xh` (half-life in hours)

### Built-in Factor Names

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `RSI14` | RSI(close, 14) |
| `RSI21` | RSI(close, 21) |
| `MOM5` | Rate of change over 5 periods |
| `MOM10` | Rate of change over 10 periods |
| `SKEW20` | Return skewness over 20 periods |
| `KURT20` | Return kurtosis over 20 periods |
| `VOL_RATIO` | Volume ratio (current / 20-period avg) |
| `ILLIQ20` | Amihud illiquidity measure |
| `REALIZED_VOL10` | Realized volatility over 10 periods |
| `REALIZED_VOL30` | Realized volatility over 30 periods |
| `HIGH_LOW_RANGE` | (High - Low) / Close |

Custom factors created in the Factor Library also work. Use the `query_factors` tool (in Prompt AI or Hyper AI) to see all available factor names.

### Example Usage

```
Current factor readings for BTC:
- RSI21 (1h): {BTC_factor_1h_RSI21}
- Momentum (5m): {BTC_factor_5m_MOM10}
- Volatility (4h): {BTC_factor_4h_REALIZED_VOL10}

Use factor IC and ICIR to gauge signal reliability. Persistent factors are suitable for swing strategies; short-decay factors for scalping.
```
