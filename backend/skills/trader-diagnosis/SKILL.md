# Trader Diagnosis

Systematically diagnose why an AI Trader is not triggering or executing
trades as expected. Follow a structured checklist approach.

## Pre-requisites (MUST confirm before proceeding)

1. Identify WHICH trader has the issue (if user doesn't specify, `list_traders` and ask)
2. Confirm the **exchange** and **environment** the trader is on

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Environment and Data Foundation Check

Before diagnosing the trader itself, verify the system foundation:

1. **Check trading environment**: `get_trading_environment()`
   - Confirm it matches what user expects (testnet vs mainnet)
   - If mismatch, guide user to switch via UI top-right mode switcher

2. **Check watchlist**: `get_watchlist()`
   - Verify the symbol(s) the trader's signal pools monitor are in the watchlist
   - If using default config (only BTC), warn user that other symbols have no data
   - If target symbol missing, use `update_watchlist()` to add it (after user confirmation)

→ [CHECKPOINT] Report environment and watchlist status. If issues found here, they are ROOT CAUSES — fix them first before proceeding.

### Phase 1: Full Diagnostic Scan

Run comprehensive diagnosis: `diagnose_trader_issues(trader_id)`

This checks:
- Trader enabled status
- Wallet binding and balance
- Strategy binding (prompt or program)
- Signal pool configuration and recent triggers
- Cooldown timer status
- Recent error logs

→ [CHECKPOINT] Present diagnostic results in plain language. Categorize issues found.

### Phase 2: Issue Resolution

Based on diagnostic results, address each issue:

**Configuration Issues (you can fix):**
- Signal pool not bound → help bind one (confirm exchange match)
- Trigger interval too long → suggest adjustment
- Signal thresholds too strict → delegate to Signal AI for recalibration

**Manual Operations (guide user to UI):**
- Wallet not bound → [AI Trader](/#trader-management) → click trader → bind wallet
- Trading not started → [AI Trader](/#trader-management) → click trader → "Start Trading"
- Program binding not active → [Programs](/#program-trader) → "Program Bindings" → Edit → activation switch

**Data Issues (investigate further):**
- API errors → check `get_system_logs` for details
- Balance insufficient → advise deposit, show wallet address
- Exchange connectivity → verify API key status

→ [CHECKPOINT] Summarize fixes applied and remaining manual steps. Wait for user to complete manual actions.

### Phase 3: Verification

After user completes manual steps:
- Re-run `diagnose_trader_issues(trader_id)` to verify all clear
- Check `list_traders(trader_id)` for current status
- Confirm the trader is now ready to execute

## Key Rules

- Always run the full diagnostic first, don't guess
- Signal pool exchange must match trader's wallet exchange
- Be specific about UI paths for manual operations
- If the issue is "signal triggered but AI decided HOLD", explain this is normal behavior
