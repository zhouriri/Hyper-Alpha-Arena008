## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
  - Windows: Docker Desktop for Windows
  - macOS: Docker Desktop for Mac
  - Linux: Docker Engine ([Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HammerGPT/Hyper-Alpha-Arena.git
cd Hyper-Alpha-Arena

# Start the application (choose one command based on your Docker version)
docker compose up -d --build        # For newer Docker Desktop (recommended)
# OR
docker-compose up -d --build       # For older Docker versions or standalone docker-compose
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:8802**

### Managing the Application

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f        # (or docker-compose logs -f)

# Stop the application
docker compose down          # (or docker-compose down)

# Restart the application
docker compose restart       # (or docker-compose restart)

# Update to latest version
git pull origin main
docker compose up -d --build # (or docker-compose up -d --build)
```

**Important Notes:**
- All data (databases, configurations, trading history) is persisted in Docker volumes
- Data will be preserved when you stop/restart containers
- Only `docker-compose down -v` will delete data (don't use `-v` flag unless you want to reset everything)

## First-Time Setup

### Understanding Hyperliquid Authentication

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) where all trading operations are executed as on-chain transactions. Unlike centralized exchanges that use API keys, DEX platforms require **private keys** to cryptographically sign each transaction on the blockchain. This is not a limitation but a fundamental requirement of decentralized architecture - your trades are executed directly on-chain without intermediaries.

**Official Documentation:**
- Hyperliquid API Signing: https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/signing
- Python SDK: https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk

**Our Security Measures:**
- Private keys are encrypted using AES-256 before storage
- All encryption/decryption happens locally on your server
- Keys are never transmitted in plain text
- We recommend using a dedicated trading wallet separate from your main holdings

### Setup Steps

**1. Create Your First AI Trader**

Open http://localhost:8802 and navigate to **AI Traders** section:
- Name: e.g., "GPT-5 Trader"
- Model: Select from dropdown (gpt-5-mini, claude-sonnet-4.5, deepseek-chat, etc.)
- API Key: Your LLM provider API key (OpenAI/Anthropic/Deepseek)
- Base URL: Leave default or use custom endpoint

**2. Get Your Private Key**

Hyperliquid supports two wallet types. Choose the method that matches your setup:

**Option A: Using EVM Wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.)**
- If you connected to Hyperliquid using MetaMask, Rabby, WalletConnect, or other Web3 wallets
- Export your private key from your wallet software:
  - **MetaMask**: Account Details → Export Private Key
  - **Rabby**: Settings → Export Private Key
  - Other wallets: Check their documentation for private key export
- This is the most common method for users who already have Web3 wallets

**Option B: Using Hyperliquid Email Wallet**
- If you logged into Hyperliquid using email (not wallet connection)
- Visit https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/ (testnet) or https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/ (mainnet)
- Click "Export Email Wallet" in the settings dropdown
- Follow the steps to copy your private key
- Official guide: https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/export-your-email-wallet

**3. Configure Hyperliquid Wallet**

In the **Hyperliquid Wallets** section, you'll see two wallet panels:
- **Testnet Wallet**: For risk-free testing with free test funds
- **Mainnet Wallet**: For real trading with actual capital

For each wallet:
- Enter your private key (obtained from step 2 above)
- Set maximum leverage (1-50x)
- Set default leverage (1-3x recommended)
- Click **Save Wallet**

**4. Set Global Trading Environment**

Navigate to **Settings** or **Hyperliquid** page:
- **TESTNET**: All AI Traders use testnet wallets (recommended for initial testing)
- **MAINNET**: All AI Traders use mainnet wallets (real money)

**5. Enable Auto Trading**

In your AI Trader configuration:
- Toggle **Auto Trading** to ON
- Set Trigger Mode: Real-time (recommended)
- Set Trigger Interval: 60-150 seconds
- Choose Prompt Template: "Hyperliquid Pro" includes leverage education
- Monitor initial trades in **System Logs**

### Safety Recommendations

These are suggestions based on best practices. Many users have different risk preferences:
- Consider testing on testnet first to understand system behavior
- Starting with lower leverage (1x-3x) can help you learn the system
- Monitoring margin usage helps avoid unexpected liquidations
- Using dedicated trading wallets (separate from main holdings) is a common security practice
- Some users prefer gradual scaling rather than maximum leverage from the start

## Supported Models

Hyper Alpha Arena supports any OpenAI API compatible language model. **For best results, we recommend using Deepseek** for its cost-effectiveness and strong performance in trading scenarios.

Supported models include:
- **Deepseek** (Recommended): Excellent cost-performance ratio for trading decisions
- **OpenAI**: GPT-5 series, o1 series, GPT-4o, GPT-4
- **Anthropic**: Claude (via compatible endpoints)
- **Custom APIs**: Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

The platform automatically handles model-specific configurations and parameter differences.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Port 8802 already in use
**Solution**:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**Problem**: Cannot connect to Docker daemon
**Solution**: Make sure Docker Desktop is running

**Problem**: Database connection errors
**Solution**: Wait for PostgreSQL container to be healthy (check with `docker-compose ps`)

**Problem**: Want to reset all data
**Solution**:
```bash
docker-compose down -v  # This will delete all data!
docker-compose up -d --build
```
